Installation Instructions:


I am trying to make this transition as smooth as I can
that is why I included this instructions. 

- Import GoogleLoginM into Android Studio
- Let the Graddle build- it can take a while
- Click install missing platforms and sycn project if 'Prompt'
- wait until download and installation is complete
- Let the Graddle build again- it can take a while...get a cup of coffee and come back when is finish..
- If you are using the emulator, I was woking with the Nexus 6P emulator so please install it.
- I will highly suggest using a physical device but if you don't have one no problem..I was just having problems with the emulator while rendering google maps..

About Project:
- There are six classes and twelve layouts that you can work on.
- Don't worry about the sign in button since is throwing a NullPointerexception
when imported from a different computer then its original

Have fun! & Happy Coding!
